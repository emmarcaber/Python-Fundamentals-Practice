# Chapter 3
# multiple assignment = allows us to assign multiple variables 
#                       at the same time in one line of code

# name = "Bro"
# age = 21
# attractive = True

# This is the shortcut above
# name, age, attractive = "Bro", 21, True

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(attractive)

# Spongebob = 30
# Patrick = 30
# Sandy = 30
# SquidWard = 30

# The same as above
Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30

print(Spongebob)
