## Python-Fundamentals-Practice
Let's go and practice some Python!

### Project Purpose
I created this repository to keep track of what I already know in Python by recording what I have learned by chapters.

### Usage
1. __Download__ the zip file or __clone__ the repository.

  ```
    git clone https://github.com/emmarcaber/Python-Fundamentals-Practice
  ```
  
2. Type in the command line the chapter you want to run by:

  ```
    py "filename"
  ```
