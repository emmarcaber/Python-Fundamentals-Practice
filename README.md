## Python-Fundamentals-Practice
Let's go and practice some Python!

### Project Purpose

Moreover, this repository follows the *Python Full Course for Free* of __Bro Code__, a giga chad master instructor in teaching programming. You can view the course by clicking this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8">link</a>.
